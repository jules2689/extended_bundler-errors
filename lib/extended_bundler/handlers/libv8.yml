      This problem is caused by libv8 being unable to find the appropriate v8 library.

      {{bold:What can I do?}}
      Mac:
      Try running:
      {{command:brew install v8}}
      {{command:bundle config build.libv8 --with-system-v8}}
      {{command:bundle install}}

      This is probably caused by compilation issues with native C extensions and Ruby.

      {{bold:What can I do?}}
      You may need to remove Ruby, Gems, and all Bundler caches.

      1. Run {{command:ruby -v}} to see what version of Ruby you are running.
         - You might see something like {{italic:ruby -v ruby 2.3.3p222 (2016-11-21 revision 56859) [x86_64-darwin17]}}
      2. The {{info:x86_64-darwin17}} part of this means that Ruby was built for darwin17 (Mac OS High Sierra).
         - If you are running a different operating system than the one specified (if one is specified),
           then you will need to remove your Ruby installation, gems (~/.gem), and bundle (~/.bundle)
           and reinstall everything
         - Remove everything with {{command:rm -rf ~/.gem ~/.bundle}} and deleting your Ruby installation
           - {{command:rm -rf /opt/rubies}} if you installed using chruby
           - {{command:rvm uninstall <version>}} if you used RVM
           - {{command:rbenv uninstall <version>}} if you used Rbenv

      {{bold:Additional steps you can try}}
      Mac:
      Try running:
