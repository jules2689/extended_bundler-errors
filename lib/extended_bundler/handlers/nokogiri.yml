      {{bold:What is the problem?}}
      The {{info:/usr/include}} folder is missing.
      This folder includes the {{info:stdio.h}} header needed for compiling

      {{bold:What can I do?}}
      Linux:
        Start by updating the APT indices:
        {{command:sudo apt-get update}}

        Then installing these packages may help:
        {{command:sudo apt-get install gcc}}
        {{command:sudo apt-get install build-essential}}
        {{command:sudo apt-get install libc6-dev}}

      Mac:
        Option 1: Install Command Line Tools.
        This may not always work and the tools may already be installed.
        It is a good first attempt to fix.
        {{command:xcode-select --install}}

        Option 2: Install SDK headers directly.
        {{command:cd /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Packages/}}
        {{command:open macOS_SDK_headers_for_macOS_*.pkg}}

        Once this is done, you should have a {{info:/usr/include}} folder with header files.
